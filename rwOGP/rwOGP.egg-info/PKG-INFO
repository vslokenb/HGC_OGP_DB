# Package for OGP + Database: rwOGP
This package is intended to be used to read and write data from the OGP to a local database. The package is divided into two parts: 
1. CLI tool for automatic upload of data from the OGP to the local database.
2. GUI to read data from the local database to the OGP

## Getting started
In Python 3.6 or greater on the OGP computer: 
```
pip install git+https://github.com/cmu-hgc-mac/HGC_OGP_DB.git@template_based
```
Then run in terminal
```
uploadOGPresults
```
If run for the first time, this prompts user to enter a secure folder/directory to create a configuration file containing information about database connection and OGP survey results. Modify the configuration file to include the correct information.

Running this command after will automatically postprocess and upload the OGP survey results to the database.

## Starting a GUI instance (will be moved into a config file)
```
cd read-write-ogp
python3 file_selector.py
```

## How to use:
This GUI contains two tabs: 'View Plots' and 'Upload Files'.
- View plots shows plots data from the OGP. (TBD: Change limit on number of files)
- Upload Files lets the user upload .XLS output files containing OGP meaurements to the local db.
  - The **watch directory** _must contain_ the following subdirectories for the GUI to work:
    - baseplates
    - hexaboards
    - protomodules
    - modules
  - The OGP inspection files _must be configured to write to these locations_ by default type.
    - The .XLS files must be saved with the ID of the component and will be used as the part ID in the db.

## How this works (for developers)
- [```file_selector.py```](https://github.com/murthysindhu/HGC_DB_postgres/blob/main/read-write-ogp/file_selector.py) runs the GUI instance
- Code for reading/writing from local db are in [```postgres_tools/upload_inspect.py```](https://github.com/murthysindhu/HGC_DB_postgres/blob/main/read-write-ogp/postgres_tools/upload_inspect.py).
- The 'Upload Files' tab calls [```process_im.py```](https://github.com/murthysindhu/HGC_DB_postgres/blob/main/read-write-ogp/process_im.py) to process data by module type.
- The processing itself happens in [```ogp_height_plotter.py```](https://github.com/murthysindhu/HGC_DB_postgres/blob/main/read-write-ogp/ogp_height_plotter.py) to process data by module type.

## To create a watcher instance (will be moved into a config file)
(To ber combined with file_selector GUI)
```
cd read-write-ogp
python3 auto_upload.py
```

## Using pgAdmin4 to view tables (Instructions to follow)
Install [postgreSQL-15 with pgAdmin4](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) on your computers. Make sure you add ```psql``` to your path.
